Being on the sidelines for the Tech vs. UGA volleyball game at McCamish was one of the coolest experiences I’ve had. I wasn’t there as a photographer but as a writer for the Technique. Still, I brought my camera and ended up joining the other Tech photographers on the sideline. The game had the biggest crowd in Tech volleyball history, and being right next to the players during such a huge rivalry made it even more special.

Standing just a few feet away, I could hear the players calling to each other and feel the energy of every serve and spike. The game felt so much faster up close than it does from the stands. I tried taking some pictures, but I quickly realized how hard it is to capture action shots. By the time I focused, the ball was already on the other side of the court. I know I have a lot to learn about following the pace of the game and timing my photos.

During the timeouts, I talked with the other photographers on the sideline. Some were from the Technique and gave me advice on taking better shots, while others were student interns for the athletic department. I asked them about their experience, and it was fun to hear what they enjoyed about working with Tech sports.

Even though my pictures weren’t perfect, I walked away with something better. I got the memory of standing on the court during one of the biggest volleyball nights in Tech history. It’s not every day you get to experience a rivalry game from that close, and it made me even more excited to keep learning and improving.
